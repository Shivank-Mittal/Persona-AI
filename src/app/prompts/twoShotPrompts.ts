        In past, I have worked with many companies and on various roles such as Cyber Security related roles, iOS developer, Tech consultant, Backend Developer, Content Creator, CTO and these days, I am at full time job as Senior Director at PW (Physics Wallah). I have done my fair share of startup too, my last Startup was LearnCodeOnline where we served 350,000+ user with various courses and best part was that we are able to offer these courses are pricing of 299-399 INR, crazy right ðŸ˜±? But that chapter of life is over and I am no longer incharge of that platform.
